# Recipe Book App

Let's create an app that models an online cookbook application.

* Fork this repo and clone it as per usual
* Generate padrino models as per your model design
* Use the db/seeds.rb to create models.
* Generate padrino controllers to action a public-facing website. Implement a full CRUD system for your visitors. Plan your application and think about what actions they will be able to see.
* Create views for your actions with nice layouts, CSS and clean HTML
* Nest your routes so that any models that are dependent on other models include their parent in the URL
* Similarly, nest any dependent models in your forms using fields_for and accepts_nested_attributes_for.
* Send me a pull request when you're done.
